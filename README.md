# Rex::Powershell

Ruby Exploitation(Rex) library for dealing with Powershell Scripts. This Library is designed to help create and manipulate powershell scripts for use
with Metasploit exploits. It is ported over from the Metasploit Framework code originally created by RageLtMan(https://github.com/sempervictus) and
 perfected by Meatballs1(https://github.com/Meatballs1).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rex-powershell'
```

And then execute:
```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```
$ gem install rex-powershell
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
